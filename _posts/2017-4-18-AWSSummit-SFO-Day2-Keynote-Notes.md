AWS organized the [AWS Summit at San Francisco](https://aws.amazon.com/summits/san-francisco/) on 18th and 19th of April. It was an eye-opener for me on the devOps progress and the adoption of cloud based work-flows. I had take some notes and thought of sharing it. This is the notes from Day 2 of the event. Hope it is of use to you!

	- NextDoor - private social network.
		- Entire platform is on AWS.
		- build and deployment time down by 10%
			- used to have weekly releases
			- Red+Black deployments: Every deployment, create a whole set of new EC2 instances. Route a small traffic and based on feedback, switch the traffic and bring down old instances.
			- dropped deployments from 25 mins to 7 mins.

# Fireside Chat featuring Andy Jassy, CEO, Amazon Web Services – RED

- Multi cloud strategy: Most customers don't do it. 
	- Standardize to lowest common stuff - that's constraining their developers
	- Learning different platforms ==> Isn't this is the same as vendor lock in?
	- Diminish buying power - essentially lose the volume discounts.
- Machine learning / deep learning - 3 levels
	- Level 0: actual mathematicians / expert practitioner (eg: Netflix)
	- Level 1: Providing tools for regular developers.
	- Level 2: Quick tools for everyone.
- Big challenge is getting data from data center into the S3.
- __Connected devices__: Over time servers at offices or homes will be replaced with connected devices. That will be the new hybrid model.
	- Tata motors manages trucks ?
- *Amazon GreenGrass* - software module that can run lambda functions that will partly run in cloud and in the device.
- Focus
	- expansion of geographical foot print: in every tier 1 country
	- DB expansion - Aurora fastest growing service
	- Container and orchestration management
	- Event driven and serverless computing
	- Self service and improving it.

# Deep Dive on AWS IoT

- MQTT is the protocol used, WebSockets is what the phones use.
- Use a shadow device for sending the control commands. This will ensure that the device gets the commands in right order.
- [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) for authentication of devices.
